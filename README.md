# API Client Generation Tools for Visual Studio

[API Client Generation Tools for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dmitry-pavlov.ApiClientGenerationTools) is a Visual Studio extension to generate `C#` and `TypeScript` `HttpClient` code for `OpenAPI` (formerly [`Swagger API`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/)) web service with [NSwag](https://github.com/RSuter/NSwag) toolchain.

Simply put, it does the same as `Add Service Reference` for `WCF` or `Add Web Reference` - for `WSDL`, but now it is for `JSON` `API`, you can put it anywhere in your project and it can generate `C#` amd `TypeScript`.
